The automation trap is real: you see a repetitive task, you immediately think "I should automate that," and three days later you've built an elaborate system for something that takes 2 minutes to do manually.

## The Automation Paradox

The biggest mistake isn't failing to automate. It's automating something that **shouldn't exist in the first place**.

Before writing a single line of code, ask: *Why does this task exist?* Half the time, the answer is "because nobody questioned it." The task is a workaround for a broken process, a legacy of a tool that was replaced, or a manual step that only exists because two systems don't talk to each other.

**Fix the process first. Automate what remains.**

## The Decision Framework

When I evaluate whether to automate something, I use a simple scoring system:

### Frequency × Time × Error Risk = Automation Priority

- **Frequency:** How often does this happen? Daily = high priority. Quarterly = low priority.
- **Time:** How long does it take manually? 2 minutes = low priority. 2 hours = high priority.
- **Error Risk:** What happens when a human makes a mistake? Typo in a report = low risk. Wrong number in a financial calculation = high risk.

Score each 1-5 and multiply. Anything above 50 is worth automating immediately. Below 20? Leave it manual.

## The Five Things to Never Automate

1. **Tasks that require judgment.** If the outcome depends on context that changes every time, a script will get it wrong more often than a human.

2. **Tasks that happen once.** Writing a script takes longer than just doing it. Don't build a rocket to cross the street.

3. **Tasks where failure is invisible.** If the automation breaks silently and nobody notices for weeks, the damage is worse than the manual effort.

4. **Tasks that are about to change.** If the underlying process is being redesigned, your automation will be obsolete before it launches.

5. **Tasks that build relationships.** That weekly check-in email you send to clients? Keep doing it yourself. The personal touch matters more than the time saved.

## Start With the Quick Wins

The best automation targets are boring, repetitive, and predictable:

- **File organization** — sorting downloads, renaming conventions, backup routines
- **Data entry** — copying between systems, formatting reports, updating spreadsheets
- **Notifications** — alerting you when something changes, summarizing daily activity
- **Scheduling** — recurring tasks, reminders, follow-ups

These are the "30 minutes a day" automations that compound into weeks of saved time per year.

## The Compound Effect

One 30-minute-per-day automation saves **130 hours per year**. That's over three full work weeks.

Stack five of those and you've freed up an entire quarter of productive time. That's when automation stops being a convenience and starts being a competitive advantage.

But only if you automated the *right* things.
