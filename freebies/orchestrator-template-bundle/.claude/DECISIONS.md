## Decisions

### [Template Entry - Delete This]

**Context:** Starting the project, needed to choose X.

**Decision:** Chose Y.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Option A: More features - Too complex for our needs
- Option B: Simpler - Missing critical functionality

**Reasoning:** Y balances simplicity with required features.

**Consequences:** Will need to add Z manually later.
